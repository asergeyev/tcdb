TCDB - minuature golang clone of tinycdb library

* Has the basics I needed in my projects, see godoc: http://godoc.org/github.com/asergeyev/tcdb
* Needs support for replace/append operations
* Needs some flexibility added to currently rigid reading interface (that should come from actual need, I'll not change it before there is realistic demand)
